# Audit Log

The `logs/audit.log` file records every request made by the scanner.  
It provides a timestamped trail of activity for reproducibility, ethics, and accountability.

---

## 🛠️ Purpose
- **Transparency**: Show exactly what was sent and received.
- **Accountability**: Demonstrate adherence to scope and ethics guardrails.
- **Debugging**: Help troubleshoot unexpected responses or anomalies.
- **Teaching**: Illustrate how probes differ from baseline requests.

## 📊 Log Format
Each entry is written in plain text using Python’s `logging` module:


- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,mmm` → Timestamp (UTC or local time depending on config)
- `METHOD` → HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`)
- `URL` → Full request URL
- `STATUS` → HTTP status code or error message
